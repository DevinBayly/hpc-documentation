## Keyboard Navigation

Navigation through this documentation can be done using only a keyboard. To navigate between menu items and links, use the ++tab++ key. To navigate between different tabs (for example, what's shown below), use the arrow keys <kbd><</kbd> and <kbd>></kbd>.

If you are having issues with mouseless navigation, you may need to enable certain features in your browser. Below

    4. Enter **7** and click the blue check mark

    2. Select **Advanced**
