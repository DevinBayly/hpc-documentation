# External Resources

Explore a number of resources beyond our center's offerings, from local community events to comprehensive software support and opportunities for accessing national supercomputing clusters. We've curated a collection of external organizations below to assist with education, research, and community building.

## ACCESS
<img src="images/access_ci.jpg" style="height:50px;"> 

!!! tip "ACCESS has succeeded the XSEDE program which concluded in August 2022."

ACCESS is a comprehensive NSF-funded initiative designed to facilitate usage of national supercomputing resources for researchers, educators, and students. These resources encompass state-of-the-art computing clusters, data and storage services, scientific applications, educational materials, workshops, and dedicated support services.

For University of Arizona (UArizona) affiliates, ACCESS presents an opportunity to leverage additional computing power and resources beyond what is available through UArizona's existing High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. Notable advantages and use cases for UArizona affiliates include:

- Researchers requiring extended computing time or additional computational resources beyond the capacity of UArizona's HPC systems.
- Users seeking computational resources for Windows-based software applications. For instance, Jetstream2, a national resource, offers Windows Virtual Machines (VMs) to accommodate such needs.
- Educators looking to harness GPU resources for classroom instruction. While UArizona's HPC facilities do provide GPU resources, high demand may lead to prolonged wait times, making ACCESS an appealing alternative.

For help with local installations, contact the College of Engineering IT services: **support@engr.arizona.edu**

Ansys-specific support (debugging, questions about usage, etc) is available through PADT: **support@padtinc.com**

To report license connection issues, contact: [HPC consulting](../consulting_services/)

## Code Commons

Code Commons provides a physical space for community and collaboration. Join to share experience, learn, mentor, discover opportunities, and work on your programming projects in the presence of others doing the same. Held every Wednesday from 2:00-6:00pm at the UArizona Library in the CATalyst Data Studios. For more information, see: [https://codecommons.net/](https://codecommons.net/)


## CyVerse
<img src="images/cyverse.png" style="height:50px;"> 

CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus enabling data-driven discovery. Their extensible platforms provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, image analyses, cloud services, APIs, and more: [http://www.cyverse.org/about](http://www.cyverse.org/about)

CyVerse is funded by the National Science Foundationâ€™s Directorate for Biological Sciences. They are a dynamic virtual organization led by the University of Arizona to fulfill a broad mission that spans our partner institutions: Texas Advanced Computing Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.

## Neuroimaging Core

Are you part of the neuroimaging community and interested in using HPC? The UArizona Neuroimaging Core has [excellent documentation](https://neuroimaging-core-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/hpc.html) to help you get started.

## Open Science Framework
<img src="images/osf_black.png" style="height:50px;"> 

The OSF is a free, open source service maintained by the Center for Open Science. Here are a few things you can do with the OSF:

* **Store your files**<br>Archive your materials, data, manuscripts, or anything else associated with your research during the research process or after it is complete.
     
* **Affiliate your projects with your institution**<br>Associate your projects with the University of Arizona which is a member. They will be added to UArizona's central commons, improving discoverability of your work and fostering collaboration.
    
* **Share your work**<br>Keep your research materials and data private, make it accessible to specific others with view-only links, or make it publicly accessible. You have full control of what parts of your research are public and what remains private.
     
* **Register your research**<br>Create a permanent, time-stamped version of your projects and files. Do this to preregister your design and analysis plan to conduct a confirmatory study, or archive your materials, data, and analysis scripts when publishing a report.

* **Make your work citable**<br>Every project and file on the OSF has a permanent unique identifier, and every registration can be assigned a DOI. Citations for public projects are generated automatically so that visitors can give you credit for your research.
     
* **Measure your impact**<br>You can monitor traffic to your public projects and downloads of your public files.

* **Connect services that you use**<br>GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, Dataverse, figshare, Amazon S3, ownCloud, Bitbucket, GitLab, OneDrive, Mendeley, Zotero. Do you use any of these? Link the services that you use to your OSF projects so that all parts of your project are in one place.

* **Collaborate**<br>Add your collaborators to have a shared environment for maintaining your research materials and data and never lose files again.
