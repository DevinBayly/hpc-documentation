## Overview

Welcome to the UA HPC! 

This *Quick Start Tutorial* is the place to be if you are new to HPC, or simply wish to take a refresher of the basics. We will cover some concepts that are general to HPC, as well as how to get up and running with the system here at UA. This should help you get up and running quickly since every HPC system is slightly different; each with its own specific commands, allocation policy, partitions, accounts, and system layout.
