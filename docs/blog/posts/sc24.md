# Supercomputing 2024
<img src="/blog/images/SC24-group.png" style="width: 350px;" align=right>

Our research computing team was represented at the recent Supercomputing 2024 Conference in Atlanta. We typically collaborate with Arizona State University (ASU) and Northern Arizona University (NAU) for booth presence. However, this year we greatly increased our footprint and teamed up with our Institute for Computation & Data-Enabled Insight (ICDI). Much work went on in preparation that enabled us to offer several VR experiences that highlighted UArizona research and iconic sites like the Biosphere 2 and telescopes that in part comprise the Event Horizon Telescope

We also welcomed Dr. Bryan Carter and Ash Black who brought VR experiences and provided conference experience for their students.
