# Access

## Eligibility 

The University of Arizona offers high performance computing resources to all active faculty, staff, students, and affiliates **free of cost**. 

Users are required to have active university credentials to gain access to all HPC services. If you are collaborating with university members but are not actively affiliated with the university, you may apply for [Designated Campus Colleague (DCC) status](https://it.arizona.edu/service/designated-campus-colleague-accounts) through HR. DCC status grants non-affiliated individuals with active university credentials required for accessing university services.

## Registration Process

* **Principal Investigators (PIs)**

    PIs (typically faculty members) can sponsor themselves for access by following the instructions on our [Account Creation](../../registration_and_access/account_creation/) page. Once a PI has successfully set up their group, they [may sponsor other university members](../../registration_and_access/group_management/#adding-members) for access.

* **Non-PIs**

    Non-PI university members may request sponsorship from PIs with active HPC accounts to gain access by following the instructions on our [Account Creation](../../registration_and_access/account_creation/) page.


## Loss of University Affiliation

Users who lose affiliation with the university (e.g., graduating or leaving their position) will lose access to HPC. They may apply for DCC status to reinstate their credentials if HPC access is needed. For more information, see our policy page on [losing university affiliation](../loss_of_university_affiliation/).
