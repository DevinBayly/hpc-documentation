# Loss of University Affiliation

## Affiliation Loss Policy

When you lose affiliation with the university, such as through graduation or leaving a work position, access to HPC resources will be automatically denied on the day of termination according to the University of Arizona Records Database.

Unfortunately, we cannot extend HPC access prior to or after the loss of affiliation. However, if you require continued access to HPC services, you may register as a [Designated Campus Colleague (DCC)](https://it.arizona.edu/service/designated-campus-colleague-accounts) through Human Resources. Once your DCC status is approved, you may request sponsorship from a university faculty member. 

## Data After Affiliation Loss

Home directory data are retained for 90 days following the loss of affiliation. If university affiliation is reestablished and HPC access is restored within those 90 days, your files will be accessible when you log into HPC again. Data stored in shared locations such as `/groups` or `/xdisk` persist for as long as the storage location is available and are not deleted after a user loses access to the system.
