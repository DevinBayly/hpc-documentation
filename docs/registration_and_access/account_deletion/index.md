## Loss of University Affiliation



Losing affiliation with the university will result in the denial of access to HPC resources. This will happen automatically on the day of termination according to the University of Arizona Records Database. Data may be retrievable if a student or employee is reinstated, or by the PI. More details are found under [Policies](../../policies/loss_of_university_affiliation/). Please [contact us for support](../../support_and_training/consulting_services/) in this case. 

If you are losing affiliation and require continued access to HPC services, you may register as a [Designated Campus Colleague (DCC)](https://it.arizona.edu/service/designated-campus-colleague-accounts) through Human Resources.
