## HPC Services

The University of Arizona offers free high performance computing resources in the Research Data Center (RDC), a state-of-the-art facility that hosts large computer clusters. Scientific research relies upon such systems to analyze massive amounts of collected data.

## Our Mission

UArizona High Performance Computing (HPC) is an interdisciplinary research center focused on facilitating research and discoveries that advance science and technology. We deploy and operate advanced computing and data resources for the research activities of students, faculty, and staff at the University of Arizona. We also provide consulting, technical documentation, and training to support our users.

This site is divided into sections that describe the High Performance Computing (HPC) resources that are available, how to use them, and the rules for use.

UArizona HPC systems are available to all university faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and designated campus colleagues (DCCs) at no cost. Researchers have access to [compute resources on our three clusters](./resources/compute_resources/) Puma, Ocelote, and ElGato located in our data center. Presently each research group is provided with a [free standard monthly allocation](./resources/allocations/) on each: 100,000 CPU-hours on Puma, 70,000 CPU-hours on Ocelote, and 7,000 CPU-hours on ElGato.

    MIG resources entered the queues on Feb 26, 2024. The 12 MIG GPUs will increase overall GPU availability on Puma by freeing the 32 GB V100 GPUs for users requiring larger amounts of GPU memory. Note: some batch scripts will need updates to work properly. [More information here](./resources/compute_resources/).

## Highlighted Research

<img src="./assets/images/home/HypersonicTravel.jpg" align="right" width="300px">

**Faster Speeds Need Faster Computation**

Professors Christoph Hader, Hermann Fasel, and their team are exploring the use of our GPUs to optimize Navier-Stokes codes for simulating the flow field around hypersonic vehicles traveling at size times the speed of sound (Mach 6) or more.

In the image to the right, instantaneous flow structures obtained from a DNS for a flared cone at Mach 6 are visualized using the Q-isocontours colored with instantaneous temperature disturbance values. The small scales towards the end of the computational domain indicate the regions where the boundary layer is turbulent.
