Every semester, [we host training workshops](../workshop_materials/) on topics ranging from intro to HPC, to machine learning, to parallel computing, and beyond. In addition, there are many great opportunities for learning hosted by other organizations within the community. Whether you're interested in learning about specific programming languages, exploring data analytics techniques, or cloud computing, there's a wide array of learning opportunities available.

Check below for a list of upcoming workshops.

## HPC Calendar

We are excited to host a full semester's worth of workshops this Fall.

| Nov 13 | <details><summary>Intro to Statistics</summary>This workshop combines three purposes, the first is an introduction to Statistics and its relevance to Machine Learning, the second is an introduction to the Matlab Machine Learning Toolbox, and the third is the use of HPC to run the examples from the Toolbox. This last one demonstrates how the HPC OnDemand functionality has very similar ease of use to a workstation.</details> | Online Only | Chris Reidy |  |  | 
|Nov 22 | <details><summary>Intro to Visualization</summary>The Intro to Data Visualization presentation aims to give attendees a select tour of the visualization field, bridging theory and practice. We will explore theory used to inform the selection of chart types, and contents that support a researchers intended message. We will then practice the standard visualization development cycle of drafting, critiquing, and refactoring for a number of examples. Attendees must bring with them material to draw with, and will leave with a general thought process that may apply to any visualization task. Optional coding exercises for applying these concepts are provided.</details> | Weaver 212 | Devin Bayly |
|Dec 6  | <details><summary>Using GPUs on HPC</summary>This workshop provides a basic introduction to GPUs, and how to access GPUs on UA HPC clusters. It provides some simple examples to demonstrate GPU accelerated computation, and discusses some common issues that arise when working with GPUs.</details> | Online Only | Soham Pal | | [:fontawesome-brands-google-drive:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o7k5EeY0vb3F_idEQiDaK2-dnNmexdBJ/view?usp=sharing)
