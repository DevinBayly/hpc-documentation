Every semester, we host training workshops on topics ranging from intro to HPC, to machine learning, to parallel computing, and beyond. In addition, there are many great opportunities for learning hosted by other organizations within the community. Whether you're interested in learning about specific programming languages, exploring data analytics techniques, or cloud computing, there's a wide array of learning opportunities available.

| <details><summary>Fundamentals of Accelerated Data Science with RAPIDS pt.1</summary>This workshop introduces attendees to the NVIDIA RAPIDS Data Science package. The fundamentals covered will show how to leverage NVIDIA GPUs to handle large datasets, while significantly reducing computational time. All of this without significant changes to existing data science workflows. [Learn more here](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/deep-learning/deep-learning-education/DLI-Workshop-Fundamentals-of-Accelerated-Data-Science-with-RAPIDS.pdf)</details> | Feb 20th 2025 | 9am - 12pm | Weaver SciEng Library 212 | Devin Bayly |
| <details><summary>Fundamentals of Accelerated Data Science with RAPIDS pt.2</summary>This workshop introduces attendees to the NVIDIA RAPIDS Data Science package. The fundamentals covered will show how to leverage NVIDIA GPUs to handle large datasets, while significantly reducing computational time. All of this without significant changes to existing data science workflows. [Learn more here](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/deep-learning/deep-learning-education/DLI-Workshop-Fundamentals-of-Accelerated-Data-Science-with-RAPIDS.pdf)</details> | Feb 21st 2025 | 1-5pm | Main Library 252 | Devin Bayly |  
| <details><summary>Scheduling and Running Jobs on HPC</summary>The ins-and-outs of running jobs on the HPC system. Provides details related to partitions and CPU-time allocations in relation to the scheduling system. Describes HPC hardware information relevant to submitting resource requests. Covers details for each type of job, including Open OnDemand graphical jobs, interactive terminal sessions, batch jobs, and array jobs. Provides best practices and clarification related to the queueing system and Slurm terminology. A basic batch job example is included. Basic programming experience including familiarity with bash recommended but not required. Participants should be familiar with topics covered in Workshops 1 and 2</details> | Feb 28th 2025 | 10:00am | Main Library 112 | Ethan Jahn |
| <details><summary>Managing and Optimizing Jobs</summary>Motivates, defines, and describes tools/techniques for managing jobs, including Open OnDemand and command-line tools (both provided by Slurm – e.g. ```squeue``` – and other tools such as ```seff``` and ```job-history```). Provides detailed examples and use cases for these tools. Additionally provides clarity and motivation for job optimization, including decreasing time to result and improving overall HPC throughput. Outlines best practices and principles of constructing optimal resource requests. Basic programming experience and familiarity with previous workshop topics is recommended.</details> | Feb 28th 2025 | 11:15am | Main Library 112 | Ethan Jahn |
